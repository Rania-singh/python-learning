# 🐍 Python Learning by Rania

Hi! I’m Rania, a B.Tech CSE student specializing in Cloud Computing 👩🏻‍💻  
I’m learning Python from [CodeWithHarry’s YouTube course](https://youtu.be/UrsmFxEIp5k?si=Xy6khtEjn55j-jzR) and sharing my journey with YOU 💫

This repo contains all the beginner-friendly Python codes I’m writing along the way—with **super simple comments** so anyone (even with zero coding background) can understand what's happening.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Click on any file to view the code.
2. Read the comments to understand what's happening.
3. Copy the code and run it in any Python environment (like [replit.com](https://replit.com), VS Code, or PyCharm).
4. Try changing things and explore!
