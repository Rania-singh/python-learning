# python-learning

Hey there!

I’m currently learning Python from CodeWithHarry's Python Tutorial, and as I learn each topic, I’m creating simple, beginner-friendly code files with super easy comments.

These files are not just for me—but for you too. So if you're also starting your coding journey, you can learn right along with me!

This is a learning-by-doing repo—each file will include simple examples, clear comments, and helpful explanations for absolute beginners.
