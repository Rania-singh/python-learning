# This is a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" on the screen.

# First, we use the print() function.
# This function shows (or "prints") messages or text on the screen.

# Let's use it to say hello to the world!
print("Hello, World!")

# That's it! This is the most basic Python program.
# It's the first step for anyone starting to learn how to code.

# Summary:
# - print() is used to show messages.
# - Whatever we write inside the quotation marks (" ") will appear on the screen.
